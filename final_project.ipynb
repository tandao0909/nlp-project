        "The widespread dissemination of fake news and propaganda presents serious societal risks, including the erosion of public trust, political polarization, manipulation of elections, and the spread of harmful misinformation during crises such as pandemics or conflicts. From an NLP perspective, detecting fake news is fraught with challenges. Linguistically, fake news often mimics the tone and structure of legitimate journalism, making it difficult to distinguish using surface-level features. The absence of reliable and up-to-date labeled datasets, especially across multiple languages and regions, hampers the effectiveness of supervised learning models. Additionally, the dynamic and adversarial nature of misinformation means that malicious actors constantly evolve their language and strategies to bypass detection systems. Cultural context, sarcasm, satire, and implicit bias further complicate automated analysis. Moreover, NLP models risk amplifying biases present in training data, leading to unfair classifications and potential censorship of legitimate content. These challenges underscore the need for cautious, context-aware approaches, as the failure to address them can inadvertently contribute to misinformation, rather than mitigate it.\n",
